### 1. Creating an animation of disease cases over time

Our goal here it to create an animation of animal disease cases registered. 

To create a new map:

```
[From Carto Dashboard]
Select "Your maps"

from there simply click on button "NEW MAP" (top-right)

click on "bluetongue_carto" dataset and click on button "CREATE MAP" (bottom-righ)

rename your newly create map "bluetongue_disease_spread" by just clicking on top-left "Untitled Map" and writing the new one

then on right panel, click the brush icon (tooltip showing "wizard" when hovering on it)

and after having clicled to "Torque" wizard, reproduce settings shown below:
```
