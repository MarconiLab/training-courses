## Targeted skills
By the end of this module, you will know how to:
* collect longitude, latitude coordinates on the field
* convert coordinates from degrees, minutes, seconds to decimal degrees

## Exercise outline & memos

There is today a multitude of way to know a speficic location (longitude, latitude):

1. traditional dedicated GPS devices
2. Google Map
3. mobile phone application

We will see in this short module how to use methodes **2** and **3**.


### 1. Collection longitude, latitude

To get the longitude and latitude of a specific location in [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com/), simply:
```
1. Pan, zoom to your location of interest
2. Right-click the place or area on the map.
3. Select What's here?
4. A card appears at the bottom of the screen with more info.
```

To get the longitude and latitude of your location while on the field, you will find various
mobile applications of interest for Android or iPhone. For instance (but you will easily find many others),
you can install:
[Polaris Navigation](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.discipleskies.android.polarisnavigation&hl=en) application on Android.

### 2. Converting longitude, latitude
Longitude and latitude can be represented in different units: 
* in ° (degrees), minute ('), seconds (''), for instance 30°15'50''
* in decimal degrees, for instance 30.263888889°

This two links will clarify how to convert from one unit system to the other:
* [Convert from degrees, minutes, seconds -> decimal degrees](http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/degrees-minutes-seconds-to-degrees.htm)
* [Convert decimal degrees -> degrees, minutes, seconds](http://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/degrees-to-degrees-minutes-seconds.htm)
