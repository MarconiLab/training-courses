## Exercise outline & memos


### 1. Add, edit and delete features via attribute table
```
Open: data/bluetongue_2014_2015_edit/bluetongue_2014_2015_edit.shp and overlay
it over Google Hybrid background layer.
```

To edit a layer, you need to toggle the "Editing mode", there several ways to do so.

First:
```
[In Layers Panel]
Select (click) the layer of interest, here blueongue_2014_2015_edit
```

then,

Option 1:

```
[In QGIS top menu] 
Layer ▸ Toggle Editing
Open the attribute table
```

Option 2:

```
[In QGIS top toolbar] 
Click on "Pencil" icon
Open the attribute table
```

Option 3:

```
[In Layers Panel] 
Right click on the layer of interest and click "Toggle Editing"
Open the attribute table
```

Option 4:
```
Simply directly open the attribute table and toggle editing via the
"Pencil" icon (top left toolbar)
```
Once attribute table opened and editing mode toggled, the top toolbar will give you all the required options: add, delete and edit features (see screenshot below).

Hints: Remember that hovering over an icon will open a tooltip showing button function.

Exercise:

```

Warning: in all cases, don't forget to save your layer once edited.
